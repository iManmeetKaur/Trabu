# Trabu
Track Bus (TraBu) is a real-time bus monitoring service available for both the users as well as the organisations. It will help you monitor the bus on its way from its source to destination and also benefit the users with facilities like booking, cancellation of tickets and boarding the train in real-time for small routes in case of long-distances. 
The system consists of three parts, an IoT device fitted into the bus to monitor its status in real-time, a web monitoring system for the Administrator to monitor the fleet of buses as well as cater to the requirements of the users in real-time. The third platform is for the masses so that they can avail the facilities of booking and cancellation of their journey via a bus or look up for a short distance journey in real-time with the help of the integrated hardware in the bus in case it has already departed from its root location. The users can also help in improving the system by giving their valuable feedback just after they have completed a journey with the buses powered by TraBu.
